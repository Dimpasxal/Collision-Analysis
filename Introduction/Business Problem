This project is about a data analysis and model building for predicting the severity of car accidents in Seattle.

1.Local government may be interested in the results, procceding with some kind of signs in specific places that warn drivers in case there is of high probability of an accident.
2.Some application software firm may be interested in the results, in order to create a devive along with an application which drivers can use in their vehicles. This device will
  do the same job, as aforementioned.

The model is built hoping to reduce car accidents by predicting when they are likely to happen and in what 'severity'.

The data source is: https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv
...and the metadata: https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Metadata.pdf

The data range from 2004.

The severity scale is 0 to 3 (3—fatality
                              2b—serious injury
                              2—injury
                              1—prop damage
                              0—unknown)...
                              
...all the incidents of the dataset were either 'property damage'(1) or 'injury'(2) so the predictions of the model will be bound to this range.

The methodoly I used was the following: Because the Severity of the recorded collisions was only of category 1 and 2, I converted them into 0 and 1 so I could feed
a logistic regression model.

Furthermore, for variable that had some meaning but couldn't be fitted in the model, I analyzed them in a different way.
For example, I figured out what are the most common place in Seatle for an accident to happen. Or what time of the day is more likely an accident to happen. 
Knowing that, local government can instal sign in those areas or the model could have increased sensitivity during 'hot' hours.

The exogenous parameters fitted well in the model, and the model does a good job predicting when it is likely to have an accident of severity 1 (property damage).
On the other hand, the model does poorly predicting when it's going to be an accident of severity 2 (light injury).
